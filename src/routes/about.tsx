            What started as a way to keep our hands busy on quiet evenings slowly turned into bouquets for
            weddings, teddies for newborns and tote bags carried across the country. Friends asked, then
            strangers asked, and one day there were more orders than evenings.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-muted-foreground">
            Today a small group of women crochet with us from their own homes. They choose their hours, they
            choose their projects, and they are paid per piece — because the person who made your bouquet
            should be able to feel proud of it.
